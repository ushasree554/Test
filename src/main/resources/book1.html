	 <p class="book-type-mc-header-h2">1.1 &nbsp;Aims and scope</p>
			<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">
			The safety of food is best assured using a preventative approach based on the application of HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) systems at all stages in the food supply system. 
			</p>

			<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">It is recognised that microbiological criteria are widely used in the food industry but they have rarely been published.  Whilst not advocating the introduction of further legal standards or the indiscriminate use of criteria, food industry experience of practical microbiological criteria needs to be shared. </p>
			
			<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">This document discusses the role of microbiological testing and criteria in support of a safe food supply. It aims to provide guidance to all those involved in producing, using and interpreting microbiological criteria in the food and catering industries. It has been written by professional food microbiologists with experience in food manufacturing and retailing, public health, food examination and also government in consultation with colleagues also expert in these fields. </p>
			
			<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">Microbiological criteria are inevitably controversial and the figures given in the tables (see Section 6) are derived from the practical experience of the authors as well as existing specifications, guidelines and standards.  Such a document can never be exhaustive and the food categories used encompass a wide range of products. Consider ingredients as well????  Where microbiological testing and criteria are considered useful by a food business, the information and figures given in this document may be used as a basis for determining relevant criteria for individual products.</p>
			
			<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">It is hoped that this document will continue to stimulate a productive discussion on this important subject.</p>

			 <p class="book-type-mc-header-h2">1.2 &nbsp;Background</p>
			 <p class="book-type-mc-header-text"> Foodborne disease and microbial spoilage of food result from the failure or inability to control microorganisms at one or more stages of the food chain, from raw material production to consumption of the final product.  The implications of situations that result in food poisoning outbreaks or food spoilage can be severe for consumers, food producers, retailers and regulatory authorities.</p>
			
			 <p class="book-type-mc-header-text">Traditionally, control of microorganisms in a food has been demonstrated by microbiological testing of samples at various stages of production and of the final product.  Criteria have been developed to give some degree of assurance that food is safe and of suitable quality, and that it will remain so to the end of its shelf-life provided it is handled appropriately.  Conformance to microbiological criteria is determined by testing. Not always – ie C of C. Sometimes by validation/risk assessment. It is recognised that microbiological testing can never give an absolute assurance of product safety or quality, particularly because of the problems involved in product sampling and the distribution of microorganisms in food.  Used judiciously however, microbiological testing is a valuable tool in the food industry.</p>
			
			 <p class="book-type-mc-header-text">In the food industry today, microbiological testing can be effective when used alongside physical and chemical process control systems to support hazard analysis approaches such as HACCP (ICMSF, 1988 (www.icmsf.iit.edu) and Codex, 2003) and other HACCP-based systems.  The HACCP system is a structured approach to identifying hazards and defining and implementing systems of control.  Microbiological examination can be used to help verify that these critical control points and pre requisite programmes remain under control.</p>
			
			 <p class="book-type-mc-header-text">Modern approaches to food safety management often now include consideration of a variety of risk-based microbiological targets such as Food Safety Objectives (FSOs), Performance Objectives (POs) and Performance Criteria (PCs) (Codex, 2005). These measures, often referred to as metrics, are used to indicate the level of control at a specific step in a food safety risk management system and microbiological criteria can be considered as a metric in a similar way.</p>

		<p class="book-type-mc-header-h2">1.3 &nbsp;Definition and Practical Application of Microbiological Criteria</p>
	  <p class="book-type-mc-header-text"> 
		A microbiological criterion consists of a statement of at least the following:<br />
		- the microorganism or microbial toxin of concern<br />
		- the food concerned and sample type<br />
		- the sampling plan (see 3.3.1)<br />
		- the microbiological limit (s)<br />
		<br />
		<strong><em>Conformance to microbiological criteria should be monitored using specified, relevant methods which have been validated for the microorganism or toxin of concern in the food being examined</em></strong> (see also 4.4 and 6.1).		<br /><br />
		
		Microbiological criteria are essentially of three types:<br />
		- Standard<br />
		- Guideline<br />
		- Specification<br />
	<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">
		These terms, as defined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex, 1981), were principally for use in Codex standards and codes of practice.  Microbiological standards, guidelines and specifications have been redefined by Codex (Codex, 1997), the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF, 1986 www.icmsf.iit.edu) and the United States Subcommittee on Microbiological Criteria (National Research Council, 1985) and for simplicity the following working definitions are generally recognised:
		</p>
	<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">
		<strong>Standard</strong> - This is a microbiological criterion contained in a law or a regulation where compliance is mandatory.  These are introduced by governments or regulatory authorities.  Typical examples include most criteria in European Community (EC)/ European Union (EU) Directives and Regulations and Statutory Instruments of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The food industry must ensure full compliance with these standards which are monitored by enforcement agencies or the industry themselves.  Products not complying with standards will be rejected as unfit for the intended use and cannot be placed on the market. Not always – only for safety criteria, not process hygiene indicators – still referred to in the doc as standards? Products already on sale must be withdrawn and, if necessary, recalled from the consumer.  Current EU and UK microbiological standards are summarised in Section 7.
		</p>
		
		<p class="book-type-mc-header-text"><strong>Guideline -</strong> A microbiological guideline is a criterion applied at any stage of food processing and retailing which indicates the microbiological condition of the sample and aids in identifying situations requiring attention for food safety or quality reasons.  Results obtained from testing against a microbiological guideline also assist in trend analysis.  Results that deviate significantly from the trend may indicate a tendency towards a situation which is out of control and highlight the need for attention before control is lost.  Guidelines are usually self imposed by the food industry but may occasionally be included in legislation.  Products not complying with guidelines should result in investigative action to identify and rectify the cause.  Guidelines on the levels and types of microorganism relevant in specified foods produced under good manufacturing practice may also be provided by industrial associations for their members. In Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 on Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs there are process hygiene criteria for raw meat and poultry, cooked shellfish, cheese, other dairy products, fruit juice and cut vegetable products (see Section 7). In the UK, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has published microbiological guidelines to assist food examiners and enforcement officers in the determination of the microbiological quality of foods and to indicate levels of bacterial contamination considered to be a potential health risk in ready-to-eat foods at point of sale (www.hpa.org.uk). These guidelines are currently being revised. Now issued	 </p>
		
		<p class="book-type-mc-header-text"><strong>Specification -</strong> This is a microbiological criterion, developed by the food industry, applied to raw materials, ingredients or the end product which is used in a purchase agreement. Criteria may include pathogens, toxins, indicator microorganisms or spoilage microorganisms where non-compliance may affect product safety and/or quality during shelf-life.  Industry product specifications have historically been more stringent than microbiological standards in order to provide a margin of safety but recent strengthening of legislative standards e.g. EC Regulation on Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs, have made such differences less pronounced for the microorganisms included in such standards.</p>
<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">
Products not complying with specifications should be investigated to determine the cause. Rejection of products may occur even if they are not hazardous or unwholesome 
at the time of testing.</p>
<p class="book-type-mc-header-text">
It is important to ensure that the components of microbiological specifications are relevant and realistic and fully understood by both parties in the agreement.</p>
